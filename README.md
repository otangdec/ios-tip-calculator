* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

Swift is a brand new langugage to me.  I found it a little bit challenging to learn new concepts about the language.  Using Xcode is not something
that I am fluent yet, but I am getting used to the IDE little by little.  Developing this app during the final exam is also another challenge.  
However, it was fun and very educational to work on this prework assignment.  Thank you!
